		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>My name is James Fong. I maintain this site as a hobby to practice and hone my programming skill with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</P>
		<p>I am a Star Trek fan, so for my personal hobby I decided to make a site about Star Trek.</p>
		<p>There's also a Whack-a-Mole game I wrote using HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Javascript. While it's got nothing to do with Star Trek, I wrote it as part of my practice</p>
		
		<p>This site is hosted on my GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/JKF007">JKF007</a>. The account also includes several of my other projects with Java and C++. </p>
